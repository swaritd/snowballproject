Returning out a dollar amount, frequency, and priority for pay back for each debt in response to user financial data. I narrowed it down to credit cards, and took into account credit card terms (T/C’s) to recommend the best payback strategy to lower interest expense, minimize credit score hit and fit a certain cash constraint. I spent a lot of time digging through the 40-page, 7pt font credit card T/Cs to uncover how the product is designed to work against any user who doesn't pay off their debt in full. Banks trying to put folks already behind on their debt in a worse financial position was something everyone *kinda* knows but my goal was to gather evidence and try to reverse-engineer a solution. It didn’t fully work out--started focusing too wide, and not enough user testing, but it was the first thing I built I truly cared about.
